# Virtual_Paint

## Code Requirements:
This program is written in Python 3.9.5 and it uses the very famous OpenCV library. OpenCV is a computer vision and machine learning software library that includes many common image analysis algorithms that will help us build custom, intelligent computer vision applications.

## Find Colors:
First, the model has to detect the color of the object. Here, i have used Yellow and Green color if you want you can just add the HSV color code. 

## Get Contours:
### What is Contours?
Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points, having same color or intensity.In OpenCV, finding contours is like finding white object from black background.
